        "The concept of Base-N numbers refers to a positional numeral system with a base of $N$. The base represents the number of unique digits or symbols used to express numerical values in that system. Each digit in a Base-N represents a coefficient for a power of $N$. The value of the exponent, for each respective digit, is given by the position of the digit from the right, with \"0\" indexing.  \n",

        "\n",
        "Floating-point numbers are a representation of real numbers in computing, allowing for the representation of a wide range of values, including both integers and fractions. The term \"floating-point\" refers to the fact that the decimal (or binary) point can \"float\"; that is, it can support a variable number of digits before and after the decimal point.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Characteristics of Floating-Point Numbers:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Precision:** Floating-point numbers have finite precision, meaning there is a limit to the number of significant digits they can represent. This limitation can lead to round-off errors in calculations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Representation:** In the IEEE 754 standard, a floating-point number is represented as a sign bit, an exponent, and a fractional part (mantissa). This allows the representation of very large or very small numbers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Notation:** Floating-point numbers are often expressed in scientific notation, where a number is represented as a product of a significand (or mantissa) and a power of 2 (exponent).\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Operations with Floating-Point Numbers:\n",
        "\n",
        "Floating-point arithmetic includes addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. However, due to finite precision, certain operations may result in loss of precision and round-off errors."

        "\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Precision Management:** Use higher precision data types when necessary to reduce the impact of limited precision.\n",

        "2. **Careful Rounding:** Be mindful of rounding operations and their effects on subsequent calculations.\n",
